This is a demo project to see how DHTMLX performs using [DHTMLX Optimus Framework](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/optimus__index.html) (DHTMLX in es6) connected to a REST API on Node using JSON and fetch.

# Plan of approach

- [ ] WIP: Restructure files [feature-oriented instead of type-oriented](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/338597/folder-by-type-or-folder-by-feature)
- [ ] add the REST API from [My version of CRM System - demo app](https://github.com/rkristelijn/dhtmlx-json-node)
- [ ] Implement the views per es6
- [ ] Add missing GUI's to create,update,delete data (sales, events, settings)
- [ ] Restructure data to save dateTypes in real dates, numberTypes in real numbers, implement bounded picklists
- [ ] Implement detail views
